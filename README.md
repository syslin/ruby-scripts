Problem 1:
Given three numbers X, Y & Z. write a function/method that finds the greatest among the
numbers.

Problem 2:
Write a program that prints the number from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz”
instead of the number & for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. However, for numbers which are
multiples of both three and five print “ FizzBuzz” instead.

Problem 3:
Loop over a string of arbitrary length, and count the occurrence of each character in the string.
Note: You can ignore accounting <whitespace>.
Eg:
Input: “hello how are you”
Output: h: 2, e: 2, l: 2, o: 3, : 3, w: 1, a: 1, r: 1, y: 1, u: 1


Problem 4:
Write a function/method in a generic manner such that it can convert from one number system
to another; consider decimal to octal and binary. This method should take in three arguments as
indicated below.
function convert_number(number, from, to)
Eg:
Input: convert_number(42, “decimal”, “octal”)

Output: 52
Input: convert_number(42, “decimal”, “binary”)
Output: 101010
